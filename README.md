# Vg's editon of MoErgo Glove80 Custom Configuration for ZMK

Key differences from default Glove80 layout:

Enabled support for full range of HID CONSUMER buttons (application launch keystrokes), like start calculator C_AL_CALC, which is disabled by default in glove80. Thanks to [this thread](https://forum.keyboardmaestro.com/t/application-launch-keystrokes-from-zmk-keyboard/38866/7) for information. It works on Win 11.

After upgrade might require BT repairing.
